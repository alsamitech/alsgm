Contributing to alsgm

By Sami Alameddine

So, you want to contribute to this game engine project? Please read this document before pull requesting.

Tips to make contributing easier:
	Read the docs to get the general idea on how the engine works.
	Go to the issues page on the GitHub repository ( https://github.com/alsamitech/alsgm ) to get ideas on what you might want to work on.
	
	I intentionally ignored the .locl directory so you can put something like a TODO file in that dierectory. This makes it easier to keep track of what it is you need to work.

Example of what a .locl/TODO might look like

Fix the bug at src/ExampleHeader.h - DONE

Add some better logging - IN PROGRESS
