# Game Engine

This is a game engine I am working on as a simple project. This game engine contains a few componetents that we will get into after this section about what makes this game engine different than most game engines

Premable:
  Game Engines are not supposed to be one-size-fits-all engines. While this can be done efficiently with a lot of effort, I don't see the point in trying to use one engine for a ton of use cases.
  Game Engines are supposed to assist with game rendering, but not abstract the APIs away. You should still be to use OpenGL functions.
  Game Engines are also supposed to be open source. Why would you make a game on a engine which has source code that you dont even know or cant even modify to your needs?
  
  ALSGM intends to fix all that.
  
**What is it?**

**What Does it do?**

**How Does it work?**



I also don't think this should be the only game engine you should ever use. If you know C++ or C, try experimenting with making your own game engine!

  *The Cherno's Videos did help me with this project, but if you want to develop a game engine for Linux like me, you will need other resources and a good knowledge of OpenGL and Xlib. If you really want, I will put some of the key components of this rendering engine in a seperate GitHub Repository
