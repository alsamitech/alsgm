Implementation Status: Implemented (vulk/)

A queue is a buffer that can hold command or information waiting to be processed.

Visualisation:
[gamer clicks]->[Q_PACKET_56]
[Q_PACKET_56][Q_PACKET_35][Q_COMMAND_STOP][C_RUNNINGMEM]->[AlsGM parser]->[AlsGM]->[action]

You can submit to the queue from one process at a time.
However, different processes can submit work to different queues simoulatenously.

NOTE: Vulkan is a low-level, C API. if this documentation ever refers to vulkan structs as objects, please feel free to correct the documentation and pull request the public repository (https://github.com/alsamitech/alsgm)
