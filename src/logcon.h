/*
 *	Author's Notes:
 *		a uchar is just an unsigned char datatype, as defined in the integrated header copybook (ihdr.h) 
 *		uchars only use 1 byte or less, which makes them perfect choice for number-based configuration opetions.
 *		So instead of a function call looking like this
 *
 * 		YIN_EXAMPLEFUNCTIONTOCALL("the string to do stuff with", "the mode");
 *
 * 		It will look like this
 *
 * 		YIN_EXAMPLEFUNCTIONTOCALL("the const char* to stuff with", 69);
 *
 * 		This just saves memory and it a good idea just for the sake of efficiency.
 *
 *
 * 		A complaint happens when a process wants to ask the user to fix a case of user-error if the program wants to log a potentical unknown bug, it should log to the file instead of the console. A complaint is differnt than a log. A log is meant to to inform the user that something is happening, a complaint is meant to complain to the suer that something is not working and may be a pottential case of end-suer error.
